# Tealeaves

Tealeaves is a Coq framework for proving theorems about syntax abstractly, i.e. independently of a concrete grammar. This independence makes syntactical theory reusable between developments, and is achieved by separating a choice of grammar from a choice of variable representation. Our central abstraction is a "structured" kind of monad that we call *decorated traversable,* which is an abstraction of abstract syntax trees. Tealeaves "core" is a Coq implementation of the equational theory of such monads, as well as higher-level principles built on top of this theory.

## How to build Tealeaves
System requirements:
- `make` (see [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/))
- [Autosubst](https://github.com/coq-community/autosubst/tree/master)
- An installation of [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/download). This branch has been tested with Coq 8.16.

Compilation instructions:
- Run `make` in the top-level directory
- Run `make clean` to remove all build artifacts (including compiled files) and start over

## Generating the documentation

Pretty-printed HTML documentation is generated by default in the `html/` directory.

If you have Alectryon installed then `make alectryon` will generate documentation under `html-alectryon/`
